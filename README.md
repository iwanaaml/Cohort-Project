**Customer Retention Analysis Using Cohort Method**

This project analyzes customer retention rates for a Superstore that sells office supplies, technology, and furniture to various customer segments, including retail, corporate, and individual consumers. Using cohort analysis, the project identifies seasonal retention patterns and provides actionable recommendations to optimize customer retention strategies.

**Objectives**
1. Analyze customer retention trends across product categories (Furniture, Technology, and Office Supplies).
2. Measure retention rates over specific time periods to identify patterns and areas of improvement.
3. Recommend marketing and product strategies to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn.

**Key Insights**
1. Furniture and Technology: Retention rates are consistently lower in the first half of the year, requiring targeted strategies such as promotions, discounts, and loyalty programs to boost engagement.
2. Office Supplies: Higher retention observed in Q3 and Q4 compared to Q1 and Q2. Strategic interventions based on successful campaigns in high-retention periods can address gaps.
3. General Trend: Customer retention increases in the last six months of the year, indicating strong seasonal trends that can guide targeted marketing efforts.

**Recommendations**
1. Develop tailored marketing campaigns for low-retention periods, leveraging insights from high-retention seasons.
2. Introduce feedback mechanisms to identify and address reasons for customer churn.
3. Optimize promotions, discounts, and loyalty programs during periods of low retention to sustain engagement.

**Technical Approach**
1. Cohort analysis performed to evaluate retention rates and trends.
2. Tools and techniques include statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling to derive actionable insights.
